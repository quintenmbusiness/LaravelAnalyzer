For models:
- Automatic Factory discovery / predict possible helpers and checks on the class if it does exist


for translations:
In url translation editor:
1.  make a middleware that tracks previous requestdata like params and all other stuff
2.  when someone goes to a page again but has ?translationEditor=1 in url
3.  we then resend the previous requestdata to the controller to essentially get the original state back
4.  we hijack the returned view file somehow, and for each place where a translation is present
5.  We surround it with a <form></form> with a action to send a post request to edit the translation
     form we give the following visual properties. A highlighted box around the translated value and if clicked it
     opens a select box to select language (auto select the currently displayed one)
     This should all be inside of the form element but this might look buggy on some element like inside a <option> we can probally in those
     cases strip it out of it or strip out the select tag itself even if the page becomes kinda weird looking then

     for variables in translations we might need to find a way where we can make those shown values wise but in a way that
     they are not really editable

    in the select box also highlight ofcourse when there is a translation missing so the user does add it.s
