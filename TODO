Create Translation checker
#TranslationsObject
      # Collection<LanguagesObject> languages
       this is populated by a method that fetches all and then makes instances for the one's that are missing in each Language by first making a combined list of all Translations
       and then going through all languages again and make the missing one's with all null data.

       This then repeats this same process but for the translations in the language objects.

       This should allow for a possibility for things like
       - automatic translation editor ui's where someone can highlight missing one's



       $folderPath
       # Collection<TranslationObject> $translations <- all translation files in the language folder


     method() getAllTypesOfLanguagesFolders <- returns all languages their folderPath



     it should be possible to also detect if they are used somewhere in the project and if they are being used in the project
     we can then display their file location, and even in the case of views if we know what view its in we can check the controllers their data possibly (unless its dynamicly generated view names)
     and figure out using that information the Route information and ability to load it in using a iframe perhaps that updates

     to make the iframe idea work the following will likely be a good plan
     - First create a duplicate file for both the Controller and the View
     - Strip away any route arguments or controller method its body with the exception of the view file call (without params)
     - Strip away any variable ur method calls in the view (this will not work on all views as there might be other reasons for crashes but it should ensure alot more function possible to in future also strip known elements that will require data  or javascript
     - create a temp route for the copied controller + view and load that in
     # edge case where a translation will require variables we will in these cases attempt to
        1. Try using the name use values we expect they might normaly would be filled by for example things with name in the variablename likely are first + last names
        2. if that does not work we will try to give it a random type of value out of a array of diffrent variable types
        3. if none of those work we will simply strip it our or display the variable name itself

        We will test all of the above out untill we have a functioning view (we will test these before showing to the user by generating them doing a request towards them and based on response figure out if it passed or not)
        this process might be abit heavy unsure of the speed it will take to fully test out things will have to time this with a huge aount of test data and thne try improve

        possibly keep the generation of this as a method where you can do it for a few at a time compared to where rest of this project eager loads everything in
